# monch

    Welcome to Mönch! Everything in the folder website/ should be all the necessary components to run the website properly. While within the website directory, flask run to start the website
and click on the link to begin use.
    You will see the homepage, which features a navbar on the top with our site title, an option to create an account, and to login. You will also see a welcome message with the day
of the week and current time. Below that is a list of all Harvard dining halls that are open. Creating and logging into an account will sort out the dining halls that you as a particular
Harvard affiliate are unable to dine at at a given time. Click create account.
    You will be prompted a username, password, and password confirmation, as well as a dropdown choice to pick your house affiliation. If you forget to fill a field, no worries! An error
will catch that. You will be redirected to the home page. Now log in.
    After logging in you are redirected to the homepage which is altered now that you are logged in. Notice that the title now specifies which house Mönch is now operating for. The navbar
also features options to pick your favorite dining halls, enter a time to plan a future meal, or change your password. Also notice that the dining halls displayed are ones that you are
now eligible to dine at, listed in alphabetical order. Now pick your favorite dining halls.
    You will now see a list of 13 dropdowns to rank your favorite dining halls. Do rank all 13, without repeating any, as an error will be thrown if any dropdowns are blank or any
dining halls are repeated. Submitting will return you to the homepage where available dining halls will now be ranked in your preferential order! Now enter a time in order to plan a meal
for a future occasion.
    You will now see multiple dropdowns to specify the day of the week, the hour, minute, and P.M./A.M. of your future meal. Submitting will output a new list of available dining halls to
you, again in your preferential order. Had you not entered preferences beforehand, they would just be listed alphabetically. Log out at any time.
